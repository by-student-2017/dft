# dft (CC0 license)

## Development version.
- For the first time in the world, a significant level of NLDFT was built in C++ with a CC0 license. 
- With only five days to work on it, there's still a lot of room to optimize and improve the code, but we hope that building on this achievement will improve the research environment for many people.
- I want someone to develop QSDFT and Spinodal versions by CC0 license.
